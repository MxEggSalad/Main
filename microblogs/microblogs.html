  ---8th of June, 2024---<br>
The start of something new... that i DEFFO didnt steal from someone else..<br>
anyways, this is the idea that kibbles never really was.<br>
I just want something that lacks production value, like what I want to achieve with my blogs.<br>
and well a text file without formatting is as informal as you can get.<br>
that was the plan anyways,,, oof. had to make it an html file with damn br's everywhere for it to work<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS. IN SPIRIT.<br>
shit this took so long to plan out that i forgot what i was saying.<br>
well, this will probably rotate every six months or something, we'll see how long the page loads get by then or smth<br>
<br>
AH AH I REMEMBERED. poems. i try to write poems. and god yes theyre sappy and about my pretty pretty girlfriend (who i usually refer to as my dog/nsx)<br>
